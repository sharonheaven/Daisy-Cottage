							A lovely cottage, ideally located for Alton Towers.
						</h3>
						The cottage is is in a lovely location. Close to Matlock if you need shops &amp; supermarkets (5 mins drive). We chose this cottage as it sleeps 6 &amp; is quite close to Alton Towers (45 min drive). We also visited Chatsworth House (great fun for the kids). The cottage is very well appointed with everything you could possibly need for an enjoyable stay. We even made use of the slow cooker! Great to have dinner ready after a day thrill seeking at Alton Towers! We had a very small plumbing issue but it was sorted within a few hours by the owners, so you can't complain at that kind of service, they couldn't have been more helpful. We would definitely recommend this cottage &amp; would certainly stay here again.

							Our family christmas holiday

						Really pleased with the cottage would recommend it!
					</h3>
						Booking the cottage was very easy and I found the owner to be very helpful and friendly in our communication. The property looks lovely from the outside, very quaint and inside is just lovely! It is very well equipped - great games to play! We had everything we needed. The beds were very comfy and we felt we had plenty of space (there were four adults in our party). The village is small and nice to walk round. There is a useful shop in the village and we ate at The Bowling Green pub one night which was also great.

						Charming Cottage
					</h3>
						Stayed for half term week at Daisy Cottage with Family of 5. It was a delight, well equipped and beautifully furnished, very cosy with the wood burner and in a charming Derbyshire village. An excellent location from which to explore the Peak District.

						Wonderful cottage in a lovely location
					</h3>
						We had a lovely week at Daisy Cottage, my husband and i, 4 teenagers and a 3 year old. The cottage is a perfect mix of modern and old, lovingly renovated and beautifully furnished and extremely well equipped. Toys/games and books for all ages are provided. The back courtyard is very private and secluded. Winster itself is charming and the cottage is tucked away down a no through road. A village store is well placed at the top of the road. The owners were friendly and helpful on the phone. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would have loved to stay longer. Would recommend most highly.

							<p>Setting of cottage was great. The owners were very helpful and even provide toys and DVD's. Stair gate was already in place as our Grandson was with us. We had taken our own as we did not expect this. Everything needed and more was provided.</p>

							<p>The location of the cottage - it was away from the Main Street with its busier traffic flow and situated opposite a playground where I could see my children from the cottage window. The views from the playground were quite spectacular too.</p>

							<p>One of the best cottages we have stayed in anywhere in the country. Well situated for most attractions in the Peaks, comfortably furnished, with a good well appointed kitchen.</p>
